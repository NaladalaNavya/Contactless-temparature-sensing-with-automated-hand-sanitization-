# Contactless Temperature Sensing with Automated Hand Sanitization

## Overview

Our innovative project, "Contactless Temperature Sensing with Automated Hand Sanitization," represents a significant advancement in public health and safety technology. In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we identified the critical need for a solution that could efficiently screen individuals for elevated body temperatures while also promoting proper hand hygiene. Our system combines cutting-edge thermal imaging technology with an automated hand sanitization station.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- Arduino IDE: The code for this project is written in the Arduino programming language, which is a variation of C/C++ with specific libraries and functions tailored for Arduino microcontrollers and similar development boards.
